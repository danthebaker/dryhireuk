                               The Funkybod muscle top is the result of intense research gathered over some years.  This, coupled with a technical approach to the materials and manufacturing technique, makes for a high quality undershirt which has been rigorously tested.

                                    Advanced fabric technology allowing the skin to 
                  breathe with microfibres for softness and comfort. 
                  All this is combined with more breaking technology 
                  in the discreet plates used for muscle sizing, when 
                  a muscle is tensed that area will feel tense and 
                  when relaxed will behave accordingly therefore 
                  making it very hard to realise one is being worn.

                                    Our muscle enhancing top is a high quality garment to accentuate the Pectorals, shoulders, biceps, and triceps.  This gives the effect of an improved posture with a natural looking balance all-round.  Worn as a normal undershirt garment, the Funkybod top is a great confidence booster for men in the same way a padded bra works for women.  Available in Black or White..

                            Your product has changed the way I wear shirts. Now I wear the funkybod shirt every day for now on. It does the job better than other things I have tried. Its more comfortable than wearing an A-shirt or a slimming shirt, but instead of just covering up or holding in my chest like a slimming shirt, it actually makes it look better. I already ordered two more last week.

                            Hi, just received my undershirt, was very pleased with it. I have lost a lot of weight since developing ulcerative colitis and the shirt will help me with my body image. It did occur to me, what a great addition it would be to have a shorter sleeved version. I know this doesn't fully address skinny arms, but it would certainly give a better body shape.
							Anyway thanks for the prompt delivery, got it the next day. Will buy again..
